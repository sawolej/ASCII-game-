Simple console game using oop

Brief description of the project

The Electric Sheep project is inspired by the universe created by Philip K. Dick in the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and expanded in the films "The Android Hunter" and "Blade Runner 2048". It is a 2D roguelike game visualized in the console with ASCII characters. We play the role of a Hero trying to escape from the city maze, which is made difficult by the presence of hostile characters.

Game rules

Randomness is of key importance in the game: maps, statistics and the names of the actors as well as their location are automatically generated. The player's goal is to go through the maze while achieving the highest possible level and avoiding the dangers that may cause the game to end prematurely and, consequently, to lose.

The player downloads the output that allows the character to move from the keyboard:

W - a step forward
S - a step back
A - a step to the left
D - a step to the right
